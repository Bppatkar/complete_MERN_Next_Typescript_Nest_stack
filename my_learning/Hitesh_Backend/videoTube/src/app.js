//! we dont have option in express to handle images, so for that there is a package, Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
// go to middleware folder --> multer.middlware.js [for more info go to npm multer and read doc]
// using multer we are justing giving folder access that we want to upload that folder files on server or in cloudinary or in AWS [just folder destination and filename]
