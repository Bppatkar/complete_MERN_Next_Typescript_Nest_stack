In mongodb database i have create one database called aggregate where there are 3 collections, users, athors and books

1. in users collection there are 3 documents
2. in authors collection there are 3 documents
3. in books collection there are more than 20 documents

# Here are some question which we perfrom aggregation in mongodb

NOTE": - Without grouping you cannot perform any operation to all the database users or all the database documents.

# Questions

## 1) How many users are active.?

### Ans: -

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      isActive: true,
    },
  },
  {
    $count: "activeUsers", // here we call it whatever we want to call we call activeUser here
  },
]);
```

## 2) What is the average age of all users?

### Ans: -

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300b5d92-ea42-41a1-b61c-9ba4b7547a7d)

```js
db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {        // i want to group those people based on age or gender whatever u want
      _id: "null",    // look , we can provide any field here with $ sign or if we want to group them by nothing then we can provide _id: null
      averageAgeCalculatorByMe: {
        $avg: "$age",
      },
    }
  }
  },
]);
```

```json
{
  "_id": null,
  "averageAgeCalculatorByMe": 29.835
}
```

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      averageAgeCalculatorByMe: {
        $avg: "$age",
      },
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
"_id": "male",
"averageAgeCalculatorByMe": 29.851926977687626
}
 {
"_id": "female",
"averageAgeCalculatorByMe": 29.81854043392505
}
```

## 3) List the top 5 most common favorite fruits among the users..?

### Ans: -

for finding the favorite fruits i need to group them based on how many unique values of this particular field can be [favoriteFruit]

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
"_id": "banana"
}
{
"_id": "apple"
}
{
"_id": "strawberry"
}
```

I have grouped them together, and now I want to count.

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      countingByMe: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

we can actually use a $sum, and with this sum, we can provide a 1 here. This 1 simply says that the moment you found any user in the banana category, let's say just add 1 value. [or simply increase by 1]

```json
{
  "_id": "banana",
  "countingByMe": 339
}
{
  "_id": "strawberry",
  "countingByMe": 323
}
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "countingByMe": 338
}
```

Now i have to use a Sorting because our question is to find the top 5, so we make another stage

By the way, you can do sort just like this. $sort......
But , You have to provide based on what field you want to do, sort , and here is another thing.

This countingByMe field is not available in my original database. But since I am into the aggregation staging of pipeline now for this particular field or this particular pipeline, the countingByMe field does exist.

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      countingByMe: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      countingByMe: -1,
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "_id": "banana",
  "countingByMe": 339
}
{
  "_id": "strawberry",
  "countingByMe": 323
}
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "countingByMe": 338
}
```

what if i do countingByMe 1 not -1 [Negative one means highest value on the top.]
just changed the order

```json
{
  "_id": "strawberry",
  "countingByMe": 323
}
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "countingByMe": 338
}
{
  "_id": "banana",
  "countingByMe": 339
}

```

I want to find out top five, top three, top one.
So I can provide one more pipeline here
**\*\*** $limit **\*\*\***

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      countingByMe: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      countingByMe: 1,
    },
  },
  {
    $limit: 2, // I only want to send you the two values of the top value.
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "_id": "strawberry",
  "countingByMe": 323
}
{
  "_id": "apple",
  "countingByMe": 338
}
{
  "_id": "banana",
  "countingByMe": 339
}

```

## 4) Find the total number of males and females?

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      totalMaleAndFemals: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "_id": "female",
  "totalMaleAndFemals": 507
}
{
  "_id": "male",
  "totalMaleAndFemals": 493
}
```

## 5) Which country has the highest number of registered users?

### Ans: -

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbc4f5e5-1b04-4c37-b7b6-a240b5508a31)

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
    },
  },
];
```

But I want to count how many documents you subbed or you grouped based on France, based on USA etc. so the easiest way is to do the counting. But no, this is not counting, this is summing up, and then we will sort them

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
      countryUserCount: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      countryUserCount: -1,
    },
  },
];
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f121fb8-caea-4cc7-9172-f1fd6c2d92cd)

if we want a top 3 or top 5 we use limit

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
      countryUserCount: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      countryUserCount: -1,
    },
  },
  {
    $limit: 3,
  },
];
```

## 6) List all the unique eyes colors present in the collection?

### Ans: -

i am just couning diff eye color for fun purpose

```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$eyeColor",
      countDiffEyeColor: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

# Dealing with Array

## 7) What is the average number of tags per user?

anytime you see an array and you want to kind of rip apart those array, spread them around, then you go with $unwind.
So imagine that there is one user and in the array there are three elements. So what this unwind does, it creates three document for that user.
The id of the user will remain same, but the only property that will change is the array value.

### Ans: -

```js
[
  { $unwind: "$tags" },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$_id", // Because remember I told you, everything is duplicated. The only value that is _id is same in array value.
      numberOfTags: {
        $sum: 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      averageNumberOfTags: {
        $avg: "$numberOfTags",
      },
    },
  },
];
```

---

### Other ways to do it

---

aggregation pipeline which known as add fields which adds a new field into the existing documents.

$size just go ahead and use a size which actually tells you the size of an array.  
$size : "$$tags"
But this is MongodB. That means there could be a chance that this tag might not be present in all the documents. then how to handle it.... see
 $size: {$ifNull: ["$tags" ,[]]},
So if null, then use the square brackets in this one. And then first of all, the first parameter is where should I look for the property which is in this case, tags. But what if I found this property as null? What should I do in that case? Treat it as an empty array. That's it.

So now based on this, how can I actually calculate the average?

```js
[
  {
    $addFields: {
      numberOfTags: {
        $size: { $ifNull: ["$tags", []] },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "null",
      averageOfNumberOfTags: {
        $avg: "$numberOfTags",
      },
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "_id": "null",
  "averageOfNumberOfTags": 3.556
}
```

## 8) How many users have 'enim' as one of thier tags?

### Ans: -

Objects are not really that much difficult to work on with because you can just access them with the dot notation. The arrays or the tags are little bit difficult to find out.

So we need to learn a little bit more of the aggregation pipeline and some of that stages to work with this one because now it's not about grouping the data. I want to have some filtration as well. So how can I use filtration in the MongoDB aggregation?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb8a51c-aabc-465f-9118-e735a0ee5dd4)

$match
Filters documents based on a specified query predicate. Matched documents are passed to the next pipeline stage.

```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      tags: "enim",
    },
  },
  {
    $count: "userWithEnimTags",
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "userWithEnimTags": 62
}
```

sum is to actually aggregate, accumulate all of that. But I just want to count all of them.
I want to use an operator known as count which counts all these values.

## 9) What are the names and age of users who are inactive and have 'velit' as a tag?

### Ans: -

$Project - Passes along the document with the requested field to the next stage in the pipeline. The specified field can be an existing field
from an input or newly computed value.
Like we want name field and age field here so , whatever the fields you want. You just want to put a 1 after that.

```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      isActive: false,
      tags: "velit",
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      name: 1,
      age: 1,
    },
  },
];
```

## 10) How many users have a phone number starting with '+1(940)?

### Ans: -

```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      "company.phone": /^\+1 \(940\) /,
    },
  },
  {
    $count: "usersWithPhone",
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "usersWithPhone": 5
}
```

## 11) who has registered the most recently?

- 1 [So negative 1 means the user who have registered in the very last will come at the very top.]

### Ans:-

```js
[
  {
    $sort: {
      registered: -1,
    },
  },
  { $limit: 3 },
  {
    $project: {
      name: 1,
      registered: 1,
      favoriteFruit: 1,
    },
  },
];
```

```json
{
  "favoriteFruit": "apple",
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "680881f16233b72c41bcdf3e"
  },
  "name": "Stephenson Griffith",
