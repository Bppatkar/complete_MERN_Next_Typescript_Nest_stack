//? Express Middleware
//*  Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

//* Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

// Execute any code.
// Make changes to the request and the response objects.
// End the request-response cycle.
// Call the next middleware function in the stack.

//? If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
