//! SQl
//? SQL is a structured query language used to interact with databases.
//* it is a language to interact with database and perform operations on it

// if it is structured then in which form data will stored
//? (1) Relational Model - Organize data into tables with rows and columns
//? (2) Fixed Schema - Require a predefined schema; the structure of the data must be known in advance.

//! properties 
//? 1) Vertical Scalability - Typically scaled by increasing the resources of a single server. (scaling up)
//? 2) Relationships - Tables can have multiple types of relationships.

//! When to Use SQL Databases
//*  When data integrity and relationships are critical (e.g., banking systems).
//* When the schema is stable and predefined.

//! When Not to Use SQL
//* For unstructured or rapidly changing data (use NoSQL instead).
//* When horizontal scaling is a priority (e.g., big data applications).
