    // JSX - JavaScript XML [with the help of jsx, we can create UI in React_JS easily]
    // In JSX, we can write HTML code inside JS [but remember it is not HTML code, it is looking like HTML (because internally React JS using Babel which is a transpiler, to convert JSX to JS) which can understand browser]
    // We can embed JS code inside JSX using {}
    // JSX support only one parent element [<></> "fragement" or in div we can add multiple elements]
    // JSX attribute class is written as className , and JSX use camelCase for attribute name instead of kebab-case for instance :- not "click" use "onClick"
    // JSX supporting self closing tags like <img /> or <input /> or <App/>
